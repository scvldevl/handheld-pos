---------------

- rewrite the frame buffer code to optimise the true colour version

- clean out the remaining original commented out cotvnc code

x improve makefile

- rework EventFilter to be more UIKit specific

x modified keys don't work on windows with free RealVNC

- separate EventFilter into a filter and a queue, thus allowing the filter to be changed more easily

- get rid of emulation buttons and multitap emulation stuff in EventFilter

- text insertion cursor sometimes appears on top of screen view after keyboard is made visible

- rotation:
	- always revert to portrait mode in the list view
	- rotate the scroller so the scroll bars always appear on the right and bottom sides

- clean up method names to match Objective-C standard

- get rid of type prefixes on variable names (i.e., b, f, and w)

- use the navigation bar correctly (i.e., one navbar instance)

- create a model class to manage server list

- clean up bools; pick one or the other of BOOl/bool and stick with it

- refactor the VNCView hierarchy to make better/proper use of delegation and code modularity
